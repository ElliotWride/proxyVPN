Step 1: Download and Install Squid
Download Squid for Windows:

Go to the Squid for Windows download page.

Download the installer for your version of Windows.

Install Squid:

Run the installer and follow the installation prompts.

Install Squid to a directory, e.g., E:\Squid.

Step 2: Generate SSL Certificates
Install OpenSSL:

Download and install OpenSSL for Windows from here.

Generate a Self-Signed Certificate: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:shCopy codecd E:\Squid\etc\squid openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout squid.pem -out squid.pem

Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information for the certificate.

Step 3: Configure Squid
Open Squid Configuration File: Open E:\Squid\etc\squid\squid.conf in a text editor.

Configure HTTPS Port and SSL Certificate: Add the following lines to specify the HTTPS port and SSL certificate:plaintextCopy codehttps_port 3129 cert=E:/Squid/etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem key=E:/Squid/etc/squid/ssl_cert/squid.pem

Define Access Control Lists (ACLs): Add the following lines to define local network access and authenticated users:plaintextCopy codeacl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24 # Adjust to your local network range acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED

Configure Basic Authentication: Add the following lines to set up basic authentication:plaintextCopy codeauth_param basic program E:/Squid/lib/basic_ncsa_auth.exe E:/Squid/etc/squid/passwd auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server

Set Up Access Rules: Add the following lines to allow authenticated users and local network access:plaintextCopy codehttp_access allow authenticated http_access allow localnet http_access deny all

Secure Request Headers: Add the following lines to remove identifying headers:plaintextCopy coderequest_header_access X-Forwarded-For deny all request_header_access Via deny all request_header_access Cache-Control deny all

Step 4: Create Password File for Authentication
Download Apache HTTP Server Tools: Download htpasswd from the Apache HTTP Server tools.

Generate Password File: Open Command Prompt and navigate to E:\Squid\etc\squid, then run:shCopy codehtpasswd -c passwd yourusername

Follow the prompt to set a password for yourusername.

Step 5: Configure Squid as a Windows Service
Install Squid Service: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:shCopy codesc create Squid binPath= "E:\Squid\sbin\squid.exe -n Squid" start= auto

**Start Squid Service:**shCopy codenet start Squid

Step 6: Verify Squid Configuration
Check Squid Configuration: Open Command Prompt and run:shCopy codeE:\Squid\sbin\squid.exe -k parse -f E:\Squid\etc\squid\squid.conf

Check Squid Logs: Inspect the logs in E:\Squid\var\logs\squid\cache.log for any errors.

Step 7: Configure Client to Use the Proxy
Set Up Proxy Settings:

Open your web browser or network settings.

Set the proxy server to localhost and the port to 3129.

Test the Proxy:

Navigate to any website to test if the proxy is working.

You should be prompted for the username and password.

Step 8: Secure the Setup
Secure Squid Configuration and Password Files: Ensure the squid.conf and passwd files have restricted permissions:shCopy codeicacls E:\Squid\etc\squid\squid.conf /inheritance:r /grant:r "Administrators:F" icacls E:\Squid\etc\squid\passwd /inheritance:r /grant:r "Administrators:F"

Regularly Update Certificates: Set a reminder to update the SSL certificate before it expires.

Enable Logging and Monitoring: Configure Squid to log access and monitor the logs for suspicious activity:plaintextCopy codeaccess_log E:/Squid/var/logs/squid/access.log cache_log E:/Squid/var/logs/squid/cache.log
